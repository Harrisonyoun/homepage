title: "From Physics to Chemistry: Rethinking Modern Social Science Through Scientific Paradigms"


---

Before the 18th century, the landscape of Western scientific thought was profoundly shaped by Aristotle's conception of nature, particularly his nuanced theories of causality as articulated in "Physica" and "Metaphysica." Aristotle distinguished between four types of causes: causa materialis (material cause), causa formalis (formal cause), causa efficiens (efficient cause), and causa finalis (final cause). For instance, in the making of a table, the wood from which it is crafted represents the material cause; its design or shape is the formal cause; the carpenter who brings it into being is the efficient cause; and the purpose it serves, such as dining or writing, is the final cause. Aristotle's natural philosophy, deeply influenced by Platonic thought, placed a significant emphasis on the formal and final causes, in stark contrast to the modern scientific focus on material and efficient causes. The origins of this profound shift can be traced to Francis Bacon, who, in his seminal 1605 work, "The Advancement of Learning," asserted that natural inquiry should be confined to material and efficient causes. He argued that formal and final causes were too entangled with human perspectives, thereby lacking the objective rigor that material and efficient causes provided. This intellectual reorientation heralded the advent of the scientific revolution, a transformative epoch epitomized by the pioneering works of Galileo and Newton.



The scientific revolution ushered in an era of modern natural science, distinguished by its dual focus on the 'quantitative' and the 'mechanistic.' Central to this paradigm shift was the systematic disregard for the concept of 'quality.' To illustrate, consider two laptops-say, a MacBook and an HP. Despite their qualitative differences in operating systems and features, we abstractly recognize them simply as 'two laptops.' This level of abstraction becomes feasible only when we set aside their specific qualities, enabling quantification. Conversely, overlooking quantity allows us to fully appreciate their qualitative aspects. Modern natural science thus hinged on the notion that all qualitative experiences could be reduced to quantitative relationships, distilling the vast complexity of natural phenomena into mathematical laws. This reductionist approach became a defining characteristic of Western scientific thought.







Early modern scientists, including Newton, often endeavored to reconcile a mechanistic worldview with deism-the belief that the universe, crafted by a divine creator, operates strictly according to mathematical laws. Using the earlier example of the table, the mechanistic principles governing its construction could be uncovered through analysis, reflecting the creator's intention. This mechanistic outlook profoundly shaped scientific thought, fostering the belief that the universe's current state results from past events and serves as the cause of future ones. It posits that if we could ascertain all forces and the positions of all entities at any given moment, we could, in principle, comprehend the workings of the universe through mathematical reduction.

Yet, this absolute framework of space and time in modern science faced a profound challenge with Einstein's theory of relativity. Einstein revealed that time and space are not independent absolutes but are instead relative to the observer, interwoven into a single space-time continuum. Despite this paradigm shift, the mechanistic faith in quantification and deterministic causality endured, with Einstein himself adhering to a mechanistic perspective. The true unraveling of this modern natural worldview, however, began with the emergence of quantum mechanics, which dismantled the very foundations of deterministic certainty that had long underpinned scientific understanding.

Quantum mechanics, with its introduction of the probabilistic nature of particles, challenges the deterministic causality that has long defined classical physics. In the macroscopic world, where we reside, phenomena appear predictable and deterministic. However, in the microscopic realm, entities like electrons defy such simple categorization, exhibiting both particle and wave characteristics, thereby eluding our grasp on their true nature. Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect revealed the particle nature of electrons, while the double-slit experiment unveiled their wave-like properties. Yet, despite these insights, the fundamental nature of these microscopic entities remains shrouded in uncertainty. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Schrodinger's wave function underscore this by suggesting that we cannot ascertain the exact reality of these entities-only probabilistic approximations. In this probabilistic framework, the classical notion of deterministic causality becomes increasingly untenable. Schrodinger's famous thought experiment with the cat illustrates that the quantum world operates on probabilities, and only when observed in the macroscopic realm does one potential outcome crystallize into reality. The observer thus plays a crucial role in the transition from 'possibility' to 'actuality.'

Given the probabilistic nature of the microscopic world, how can we sustain a deterministic natural science? This necessitates a critical reassessment of the deterministic causality that has underpinned modern scientific thought. It is important to acknowledge that the deterministic causality celebrated in modern science often pertains not to living nature, but to artificially controlled conditions. The possibility of deterministic causality in such contexts arises from the assumption of "reversibility." Consider, for example, the second law of thermodynamics: when hot and cold water mix, the result is tepid water, a process that is irreversible; the tepid water will not spontaneously separate back into hot and cold components. Nature progresses towards increasing entropy, or disorder. In quantum mechanics, Schrodinger's wave function operates under the assumption of reversibility in its temporal understanding, yet when we account for thermodynamic entropy, the concept of causality becomes more complex and less deterministic.

Ilya Prigogine critiques quantum mechanics from this perspective. He argues that while the introduction of probability shakes the foundations of deterministic causality rooted in quantification, the true challenge to modern natural science lies in the restoration of quality. Prigogine's work in systematizing nonequilibrium thermodynamics emphasizes entropy, reintroducing the qualitative distinctions between elements and molecules that had been obscured by the obsession with quantification. Entropy, formalized in statistical mechanics through the work of Boltzmann, embodies a 'qualitative probabilism.' In this way, the concept of entropy transcends the quantitative determinism that has been a cornerstone of modern natural science-a revolutionary insight astutely recognized by Prigogine.

When observing a swiftly flowing river, one might notice small, spontaneous systems like vortices forming. These orders emerge precisely at moments when entropy increases in nonequilibrium states, signifying that new order can arise spontaneously from disorder. Once formed, this order can only be understood retrospectively, in relation to the surrounding laminar or turbulent flow. This discovery moves beyond deterministic causality, challenging the modern scientific worldview that perceives the past, present, and future as deterministically linked. The deterministic perspective allows no room for the emergence of new order or the concept of 'becoming.' Prigogine, who succeeded in conceptualizing 'becoming' through nonequilibrium thermodynamics, notes in his book From Being to Becoming: "For classical scientists, including Einstein, science was an effort to transcend the world of phenomena, to reach the eternal world governed by the highest rationality-the world of Spinoza. However, more delicate forms of reality exist that are related simultaneously to laws and games, to time and eternity."

Prigogine often praised Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy of process, particularly in his major work Process and Reality. This admiration likely stems from the fact that while physics focuses on quantitative changes in the microscopic world, chemistry-Prigogine's field-is more concerned with qualitative changes in the macroscopic world. Prigogine's emphasis on the spontaneous emergence of order from turbulence resonates with Whitehead's logic of concrescence, where diverse elements coalesce to create something new.

These philosophical discussions have profound implications for the social sciences. Schrodinger's perspective, for instance, aligns closely with the system of representative democracy, where individual political will remains elusive, yet collective opinion crystallizes into decisions through elected representatives, mirroring deterministic causality. However, the exact political will of individuals remains an enigma. Prigogine's viewpoint suggests that while a new system may not yet exist, it could realistically emerge from the current one. The turbulence and conflict within a community, which might appear as disorder, actually create the conditions for the spontaneous emergence of new order. This idea connects to the distinction in political theory between the social and political realms. While the social realm seeks to reduce conflict and converge on common values, the political realm, characterized by diverse opinions, generates conflict and increases disorder. Yet, within this disorder lies the potential for new order, allowing for the continuous inclusion of new ideas and perspectives. Unlike Schrodinger's view, Prigogine's perspective permits individual political wills to be more qualitatively expressed.

In economics, where discussions often attempt to aggregate individual behaviors to explain macroeconomic phenomena, modern deterministic perspectives still dominate theoretical explanations. However, while economics may resemble physics in its deterministic aspects, it also mirrors chemistry, where qualitative changes and relationships give rise to new creations in human interactions. Perhaps it is time to move beyond the modern deterministic quantification and reductionism, and restore the dimension of quality that has long been neglected.
