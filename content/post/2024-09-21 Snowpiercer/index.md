title: "From Postmodernism to a Return to Modernity: Snowpiercer (2013)"
---

**1. Snowpiercer (2013)- Film Overview**

Bong Joon Ho's Snowpiercer (2013) is a Korean film, produced and distributed by three prominent Korean film companies, yet it exhibits the polished aesthetics of a Hollywood blockbuster. Adapted from the French graphic novel *Le Transperceneige* by Jean-Marc Rochette and Jacques Lob, the film deliberately blends cinematic techniques reminiscent of Western blockbusters, as was Bong's intention. To achieve this, Hollywood's David Minkowski was brought on board as a producer, along with renowned actors such as Chris Evans, Ed Harris, and Tilda Swinton, alongside other Hollywood professionals. Yet, Snowpiercer deviates significantly from the conventional Hollywood mold by presenting a bleak, nihilistic critique of capitalism. Through its narrative and film techniques, the film interrogates essentialist beliefs, challenging societal norms that perpetuate class distinctions and systemic inequality.

The plot unfolds in a dystopian future where Earth has succumbed to a cataclysmic freeze, with the remnants of humanity confined to a perpetually moving train. This train, divided into numerous compartments (1001 in the original graphic novel), symbolizes various social strata. The rear end of the train, housing the impoverished proletariat, stands in stark contrast to the front, where Wilford, the omnipotent creator of the "eternal engine," resides. This train, which has circled the globe non-stop for 18 years, is a microcosm of society's rigid hierarchy, where halting its movement equates to the end of humanity, with Wilford deified as the preserver of life. The film's momentum hinges on the unfolding revolution led by Curtis, a passenger from the tail section, as he and his comrades attempt to topple the entrenched power at the head of the train.

**2. Film Analysis**

*2.1. The Train as a Metaphor for Capitalism*

The incessant forward motion of the train serves as a powerful allegory for capitalism, specifically as an emblem of modernity. The train's "eternal engine" evokes the ceaseless drive for economic expansion, mirroring capitalism's insatiable pursuit of perpetual growth---a theme that has become central to the contemporary economic system (Heilbroner, 2000, pp. 53-92). The fear of economic stagnation, much like the train's potential halt, is portrayed as an existential crisis, a sentiment often propagated by media to instill the necessity of continuous consumption. In Snowpiercer, the passengers are conditioned to equate the cessation of the train's movement with their demise, just as modern societies are conditioned to view economic deceleration as catastrophic. Only the revolutionaries, unafraid of systemic collapse, challenge this deeply ingrained belief in the film. The concept of equilibrium, fundamental to classical economics, is invoked to justify the distribution of resources across the train's compartments, each representing a distinct social class.


The film's revolution, symbolizing the ideological clash of the Cold War-capitalism versus socialism-represents a deeper struggle between leftist and rightist ideologies. Though the train's direction is not explicitly stated, the proletariat consistently advances to the right, underscoring a symbolic alignment with capitalist progression. Key scenes, such as the New Year's celebration on Yekaterina Bridge, further emphasize the impending collapse of capitalism as the train crosses Russian territory. Yet the revolution's success remains questionable, as Curtis, upon confronting the truth of the train's system, is nearly persuaded to assume Wilford's mantle, reflecting the cyclical nature of political power struggles.

*2.2 The Repetition of the System*

Nam, the train's door designer, envisions escape not through revolutionary ascent to the engine but by breaking free from the system altogether---an allegory for transcending capitalism's confines. The industrial waste substance, Kronole, a potent hallucinogen for most passengers, doubles as an explosive that Nam plans to use to blow open the side door of the train. This dual purpose positions Kronole as a metaphor for the discursive episteme of human progress. As Nam collects Kronole from various train sections, each symbolizing a different stage in human development-food production, water usage, agriculture, and industrialization---he embodies the philosopher who learns from history to break free from the repetition of an oppressive system.

The train's cyclical nature is further highlighted by a scene where it traverses a U-shaped route. The characters momentarily lose their sense of direction, visually blurring the distinction between left and right. Here, Bong Joon Ho subtly shifts the focus from political ideologies to hierarchical power dynamics. The positioning of the characters during this sequence underscores the futility of merely replacing one oppressor with another, while simultaneously suggesting that revolutions aimed solely at power acquisition risk perpetuating the same system they seek to dismantle.

*2.3 Preordained Class and Objective Natural Laws*

The rigid compartmentalization of Snowpiercer's train mirrors the class stratification inherent in capitalist societies. Passengers in the tail section subsist on protein bars, while those in the front enjoy luxury. Minister Mason's speech to the tail passengers, in which she asserts their "preordained" position in life, echoes the capitalist notion of meritocracy, wherein social mobility is ostensibly determined by one's innate talents and efforts. However, this ideology, rooted in essentialist definitions of class, overlooks the entrenched power dynamics that perpetuate inequality (Ching et al., 2007, pp. 104-109). The film's use of high-angle shots and Mason's authoritative posture visually reinforce her dominance over the tail passengers, who are denied a voice and rendered passive recipients of fate.

Economist Thomas Piketty's analysis in Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2014) debunks the meritocratic myth, demonstrating through statistical evidence that wealth accumulation far outpaces the returns on labor, ensuring that social mobility is more a function of inheritance than effort. In Snowpiercer, this economic disparity is personified by Wilford, whose control of the engine places him beyond reproach, his wealth and power inherited rather than earned. The indoctrination of children in the train's school section, where tail passengers are portrayed as lazy and inferior, illustrates how education can be used as a tool to reinforce class consciousness and perpetuate economic hierarchies when controlled with specific intent.


The systemic reproduction of inequality is symbolized by the ritualistic serving of Wilford's eggs, a moment imbued with religious reverence. Wilford is deified in the process, mirroring the capitalist glorification of those positioned at the top of the social hierarchy. By employing vertical camera angles, Bong underscores the omniscient view of power in Snowpiercer, illustrating how class distinctions are perpetuated through both ideological and physical stratification within the train.

Snowpiercer, with its depiction of a perpetually running train, critiques the cyclical nature of modern systems, where revolutions against the status quo often give rise to new hierarchies. Through visual metaphors and narrative progression, the film dismantles essentialist ideologies that support societal structures, offering a sharp reflection on power dynamics and class in contemporary society.

*2.4 Back to Modernity: Open Discourse*

The inherent characteristics of the train and modernity are closely intertwined. Both systems are built upon essentialist definitions that perpetuate rigid structures and hierarchies. If there is any distinction between them, it lies in the postmodern critique that seeks to deconstruct these essentialist frameworks within contemporary society. The film symbolizes the perpetual engine as a remnant of modernity, exploring the essentialist underpinnings of ideologies while simultaneously critiquing it.

In the film's climactic scene between Wilford and Curtis, we see a powerful commentary on both modern and contemporary history. As Nam and Curtis approach the engine room, Nam is shot by Wilford's secretary, while Curtis is invited to converse with Wilford, reflecting the historical clash between capitalism (represented by Wilford) and socialism (represented by Curtis). Their conversation about humanity's future can be interpreted as a metaphor for Western domination and the racial inequalities that persist in contemporary society. Nam and his daughter, representing the marginalized, are violently excluded from this conversation, while a black child is reduced to mechanical labor beneath the train's floor, having lost his autonomy and agency.

These characters---Nam, his daughter, and the black child???are symbolic of the Third World, nations and peoples historically subjugated by the imperialist struggles between capitalist and socialist powers. Though modernity's colonial forces have given way to postmodern globalization, the essential inequalities persist. As modernity pursues the endless creation of new values and capitalism strives for infinite growth, the underlying dynamics remain unchanged. However, the concept of the Third World is no longer strictly bound by race or nationality but is now increasingly determined by economic position within a globalized society. In this sense, The film critiques the pervasive essentialism of today's global system, using the metaphor of the eternal engine to turn back the clock to the era of modernity.

Nam's desire to blow up the train symbolizes the revolutionary impulse to break free from the entrenched economic system, and his success in doing so visualizes the triumph of the oppressed over the system that exploits them. Through the film's consistent use of the 180---degree rule and purposeful direction, the collapse of the train from the right end is depicted as the revolutionaries' victory.

The train's system had already begun to fail before the collapse, as evidenced by the need for a black child to maintain the engine. This visual metaphor critiques the inherent flaws of the system, exposing the exploitation of the vulnerable as integral to the system's survival. The film thus prompts us to reflect on the formation of our current globalized system and its continuities with modernity.

In the end, the two survivors of humanity are an Asian girl and a black child, both marginalized figures during modernity. The future of humankind rests in the hands of those who have been oppressed by essentialist definitions and one-sided systems. Director Bong Joon-ho may have envisioned hope in these characters, suggesting that they represent the possibility of a future liberated from Western domination. As the film leaves the fate of these survivors uncertain, it asks us to imagine a new history in which essentialism no longer dictates human lives. The train has stopped running, and the two children confront the daunting reality of an unknown world. It is in their hands to write the next chapter of human history, free from the constraints of the old systems.
