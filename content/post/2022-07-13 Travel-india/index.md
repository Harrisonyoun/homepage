title: Motivation to be an economist
---

It was about 10 years ago that made me realize economics is truly important to the real world. I was backpacking in India for several months at that time. While I was backpacking on a minimum amount of money, I got used to the lives of local people with below-average wages and realized how different living in India was from the lives I had lived. When I stayed in Mumbai, for the first time, I seriously started to think about why the huge economic gap between the rich and the poor occurs while staying in the Dhobi Ghat. People who work at Dhobi Ghat (called Dhobi Wallah) make a living by doing laundry for generations, but they often do not get out of Dhobi Ghat. The fate of having to try several times more to play fair games without being given fair opportunities depending on the environment from birth seemed too harsh.

Why can't someone get out of the vicious cycle of poverty even if they work hard and someone can live comfortably without labor? What should someone do to get out of an economic vicious circle? These kinds of endless questions made me uncomfortable, but I couldn't hide my excitement after knowing that economics was a discipline that had the power to change these social phenomena.

After my travel, I began to look seriously at economics books, and eventually, it became a great motivation for me to study economics. At the beginning of my undergrad study, of course, I had a strong interest in wealth inequality and development economics, but as I studied more, I became more interested in other areas of economics. 

My interest in wealth inequality is still ongoing on the one hand. Although the perspectives are a little different, the labor and applied microeconomics studies I am focusing on are more fundamentally aimed at discovering the economic choices and behaviors of individuals, and the future society we will face due to population aging may go beyond inequality and plunge everyone into an economic swamp. I am now paying more attention to the impact of structural changes caused by population aging on various parts of the economy and how to respond to them.
