title: Motivation to be an economist
---

It was about 10 years ago that made me realize that economics is truly important to the world. I was backpacking in India for several months at that time. While I was backpacking on a minimum amount of money, I got used to the lives of local people with below-average wages and realized how different living in India was from the lives I had lived. When I stayed in Mumbai, for the first time, I seriously started to think about why the huge economic gap between the rich and the poor occurs. Why can't someone get out of the vicious circle of poverty with arduous labor and why can someone live without labor?

After my travel, I began to look seriously at economics books, and eventually, it became a great motivation for me to study economics. At the beginning of my undergrad study, of course, I had a strong interest in wealth inequality and development economics, but as I studied more, I became more interested in other areas of economics. In addition, I came to understand inequality was a convoluted problem that is hard to solve. 

My interest in wealth inequality is still ongoing on the one hand. Although the perspectives are a little different, the labor and applied microeconomics studies I am focusing on are more fundamentally aim at discovering economic choices and behaviors of individuals, and the future society we will face due to population aging may go beyond inequality and plunge everyone into an economic swamp. So, I am now paying more attention to the impact of structural changes caused by population aging on various parts of the economy and how to respond to them.
