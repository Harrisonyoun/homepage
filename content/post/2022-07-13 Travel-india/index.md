title: Motivation to be an economist
---

About a decade ago, I embarked on a backpacking adventure through India, seeking adventure and cultural immersion. Little did I know, this journey would ignite a profound realization about the critical role economics plays in shaping our world.

During my travel, I found myself in Mumbai's bustling Dhobi Ghat, a mesmerizing labyrinth where generations of workers, known as Dhobi Wallahs, toiled tirelessly in laundry services. Amidst the vibrant chaos of this community, I couldn't help but notice the glaring economic disparities that permeated daily life.

Living amongst communities earning below-average wages, I was struck by the resilience of individuals trapped in cycles of poverty despite their relentless hard work. Conversely, I witnessed others living comfortable lives without breaking a sweat, highlighting the unjust distribution of economic opportunities.

These observations sparked a whirlwind of introspection, propelling me to delve deeper into the mechanisms perpetuating such inequalities. It was in the heart of Dhobi Ghat that I came face to face with the transformative power of economics in addressing these social injustices.

Upon returning from my journey, I immersed myself in economics literature with newfound fervor, driven by a desire to understand and challenge the status quo. While my initial focus revolved around wealth inequality and development economics, my academic pursuits gradually expanded to encompass labor economics and applied microeconomics.

Today, my passion for economics remains as fervent as ever. As I embark on my research journey, I find myself drawn to the profound impacts of population aging on economic structures. I am deeply intrigued by how these structural shifts will ripple across various sectors of the economy and am committed to devising innovative strategies to navigate the challenges they pose.

In retrospect, my backpacking adventure through India served as a catalyst for my academic and intellectual journey in economics. It is a constant reminder of the power of personal experiences to shape our understanding of the world and fuel our passion for creating positive change.
