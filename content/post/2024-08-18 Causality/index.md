title: "The Philosophical Parallels of Economics: Structural and Reduced Form Models, and the Search for Truth"
---

As I sat in my room reading Markus Gabriel's "Why the World Does Not Exist," which explores an ontological approach to bridging metaphysics and post-modern worldviews, I found myself drawing an unexpected parallel to the ongoing debate in economics between structural models and reduced form approaches. In metaphysics, there's a belief in an objective truth that governs the physical world, while post-modernism suggests that much of what we consider truth is a human construct.

This contrast brought to mind the essence of structural modeling in economics. Structural models, akin to metaphysical perspectives, impose a specific framework on the world we aim to understand, grounded in a set of reductive assumptions. This enable researchers to construct a data-generating process (DGP) that allows for the exploration of counterfactuals and a deeper understanding of causality. However, if the assumptions underlying these models are flawed, the entire constructed framework may fail to accurately capture real-world behaviors.

In contrast, reduced-form approaches in economics resonate more with a post-modernist spirit. They seek to minimize assumptions about underlying structures, focusing instead on inductive empirical verification. These approaches strive to understand the world with as few preconceptions as possible. The tension between these two methodologies reflects the broader philosophical debate, offering valuable insights into how we interpret and model the complexities of the world around us.

Much like Heckman and Pinto (2024) and Todd and Wolpin (2023), many thinkers deeply understand the two seemingly different worlds of structural models and reduced-form approaches, yet seek to harmonize them. In addition, numerous researchers bridge their empirical estimands to what Heckman referred to as "stable equations" within a structural model, creating a cohesive link between empirical analysis and theoretical structure. 

As a labor economist, whose primary tool for understanding the world is causal analysis, I still find it challenging to position myself between these two major schools of thought. It often feels like a space where one's beliefs about the world dictate the direction. Since the start of my career in economics, I've grappled with these ideas, engaging with people who strongly advocate for one side while dismissing the other. I've often been advised to choose a side and not dwell on the alternative, but I continue to strive for a balance between them.

When we impose a structure on the world using a set of assumptions, we can isolate entities within our theoretical framework to behave in predictable ways, making the model universally applicable. However, empirically understanding these behaviors requires accounting for numerous factors to identify relevant channels, which are often obscured by unobservable elements.

Markus Gabriel's book presents an intriguing idea that truth exists within specific fields of existence rather than as a universal truth. For instance, among countless existing options, only certain options capture our attention and become part of our world. This reflection led me to consider microorganisms in my room. Despite sharing the same space and time, I don't acknowledge their presence; they are not relevant to my perception of the world.

Do microorganisms affect my behaviors? Potentially, yes. If I am aware of their existence and consider them in my decisions, such as through hygiene practices, they become a part of my world and can influence me. However, since I do not consciously recognize them, they may affect me in ways that remain unknown to me.

Before this realization, I had a feeling that everything might be relevant to my empirical designs and attempted to incorporate as many factors as possible into my study. This reflection has been instrumental in helping me identify which factors are truly significant, which are negligible, and how to differentiate between exogenous and endogenous variables. It has also guided me in narrowing down the channels for understanding causal relationships. 

I am hopeful to gain a deeper understanding of how to reconcile the two seemingly separate worlds, as Markus suggests, by exploring alternative perspectives.
