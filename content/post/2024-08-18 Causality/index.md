title: "The Philosophical Parallels of Economics: Structural Models, Reduced-Form Approaches, and the Search for Truth"
---

As I sat in my room reading Markus Gabriel's "Why the World Does Not Exist", which explores an ontological approach to bridging metaphysics and post-modern worldviews, I found myself drawing an unexpected parallel to the ongoing debate in economics between structural models and reduced-form approaches. In metaphysics, there's a belief in an objective truth that governs the physical world, while post-modernism suggests that much of what we consider truth is a human construct.

This contrast brought to mind the essence of structural modeling in economics. Structural models, akin to metaphysical perspectives, impose a specific framework on the world we aim to understand, grounded in a set of reductive assumptions. This enables researchers to construct a data-generating process (DGP) that allows for the exploration of counterfactuals and a deeper understanding of causality. However, if the assumptions underlying these models are flawed, the entire framework may fail to accurately capture real-world behaviors.

In contrast, reduced-form approaches in economics resonate more with a post-modernist spirit. They seek to minimize assumptions about underlying structures, focusing instead on inductive empirical verification. These approaches strive to understand the world with as few preconceptions as possible. The tension between these two methodologies reflects the broader philosophical debate, offering valuable insights into how we interpret and model the complexities of the world around us.

Much like Heckman and Pinto (2024) and Todd and Wolpin (2023), many thinkers deeply understand the two seemingly different worlds of structural models and reduced-form approaches yet seek to harmonize them. In addition, numerous researchers bridge their empirical estimands to what Heckman referred to as "stable equations" within a structural model, creating a cohesive link between empirical analysis and theoretical structure.

As a labor economist, whose primary tool for understanding the world is causal analysis, I still find it challenging to position myself between these two major schools of thought. It often feels like a space where one's beliefs about the world dictate the direction. Since the start of my career in economics, I've grappled with these ideas, engaging with people who strongly advocate for one side while dismissing the other. I've often been advised to choose a side and not dwell on the alternative, but I continue to strive for a balance between them.

When we impose a structure on the world using a set of assumptions, we can isolate entities within our theoretical framework to behave in predictable ways, making the model universally applicable. However, empirically understanding these behaviors requires accounting for numerous factors to identify relevant channels, which are often obscured by unobservable elements.

Markus Gabriel's book presents an intriguing idea: that truth exists within specific contextual fields of existence rather than as a universal truth. For instance, among countless existing options, only certain ones capture our attention and become part of our world. He argues that if we consider the universe as our entire world, it is, in fact, much smaller than "the world" as we experience it. Our understanding of the concept of the universe is rooted in physics, but this framework doesn't fully capture my personal world, such as my experiences within the economics department at OSU, where I'm governed by responsibilities like TA, research, and the relationships I build. Outside the department, however, my world is governed by different rules, contexts, and factors. He doesn't deny the existence of the world from a physics perspective; rather, he suggests that the nature of existence and our world can shift and coexist depending on perspective and context (This idea intriguingly parallels the concept of the "rhizome" explored by Felix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze in their book "A Thousand Plateaus", where they discuss how different fields and experiences interconnect in a non-hierarchical and fluid manner).


This reflection led me to consider the microorganisms in my room. Despite sharing the same space and time, I don't acknowledge their presence; they are not relevant to my perception of the world. Do microorganisms affect my behavior? Potentially, yes. If I am aware of their existence and consider them in my decisions, such as through hygiene practices, they become a part of my world and can influence me. However, since I do not consciously recognize them, they may affect me in ways that remain unknown to me.


Before this insight, I often struggled with the extent to which the subjects of my research could be deemed genuinely independent and unaffected by external factors, and how unseen influences might subtly impact outcomes, especially when attempting to uncover causality. In this light, Markus Gabriel's concept of existential fields provides significant insight into how to approach the study of labor economics. His idea, which emphasizes the existence of entities within specific contextual backgrounds, resonates deeply with the way labor economics acknowledges and explores subjects governed by particular settings. This approach allows for a nuanced examination of existence without fully leaning towards either metaphysical ontology or post-modernism, thereby clarifying the reality of entities within specific spaces and times. This perspective leads me to question the necessity of the frequent theoretical and empirical dichotomy observed among scholars. Metaphysical values sought in theories can become untenable if their foundational assumptions do not align with reality, while empirical approaches, with their reliance on inductive methods, often grapple with issues like the "black swan" problem-challenges of infinite proof. Perhaps it is this very pursuit of reconciling these perspectives that has drawn me to labor economics. The more I delve into labor economics, the more I perceive it as a field rich in philosophical perspectives and continuously evolving. It seems to advance philosophically, bridging theoretical and empirical divides in a meaningful way.
