title: "Labor Market Responses to Health Insurance Decoupling"
date: "2025-04-12T00:00:00Z"
summary: "In this paper, I examine the labor market responses when employer sponsored health insurance, the single largest U.S. health insurance covering 165 million Americans, is decoupled from the U.S. labor market. This systematic decoupling creates spillovers and labor market distortions through feedback loop and reallocate the incentive structures of broader U.S. workforce. I both theoretically and empirically examine the mechanisms. My results carry important implications for U.S. health insurance policy, which currently spend 24 percent of the federal budget."
