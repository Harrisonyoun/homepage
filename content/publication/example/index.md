abstract: This study examined the stability over time of activities of daily living (ADL) items in 3 comparable longitudinal data sets and evaluated ADL loss sequences for older adults in the United States, South Korea, and Japan. Item calibrations were sufficiently stable across measurement periods in each data set, reflecting a stable frame of reference. Scale stability is essential when exploiting longitudinal data to analyze patterns in ADL disabilities. The consistency in ADL scales across measurement periods supports their use as screening tools and identifying those at risk for transitions in care. Interventions to reduce dependency in bathing and dressing can help improve independent functioning for community-dwelling older adults.
