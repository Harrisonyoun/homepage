Welcome to my homepage! 

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the Ohio State University (OSU). 

Prior to joining OSU, I spent 2 years as a research associate at National University of Singapore (NUS), focusing on the economics of aging and measurement.

My research interests are labor economics and the intersection between family economics and population aging. I use causal inferences to answer my research questions. 

My current research delves into how public transfers impact on private intergenerational transfers amidst rapid demographic shifts. I investigate the government's role in family spillover effects, leveraging a staggered adoption design.

Recently, I published a paper examining the consistency of surveyed data across individuals and methods for consistent measurement.
