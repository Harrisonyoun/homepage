I am currently a Ph.D. student in Economics at the Ohio State University. I was a research associate at National University of Singapore (NUS) for 2 years before joining the OSU. 

My primary research interests lie in the intersection between economics and population aging. Facing unprecedented changes generating vicious cycles in our society arising from population aging, I see it as our task as economists to contribute fruitfully to the public debate about these pressing economic issues of today to be a part of the solution.
