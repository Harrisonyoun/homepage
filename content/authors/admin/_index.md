I am a PhD student in Economics at the Ohio State University (OSU). 

Before joining the OSU, I was a research associate at National University of Singapore (NUS) for 2 years. 

My primary research interests are labor economics and the intersection between economics and population aging. 

I am currently working on how inter-vivos family transfers dynamically response to unconditional public transfers. Both upstream and downstream transfers are involved with dynamic life-cycle profiles, such as consumption, saving, human capital investment, birth outcomes, living arrangement and etc.  

My recently published paper questions whether surveyed data consistently measures subjectively valued answers from different individuals and investigates the methods of consistent measurement of survey data. I am currently working on the social security decision-making of the old and family formation decisions of the young.
